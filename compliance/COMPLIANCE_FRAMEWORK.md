## Data Privacy

### Privacy by Design

**Principles**:
1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
3. **Storage Limitation**: Retain data only as long as needed
4. **Transparency**: Clear privacy notices
5. **User Control**: Members control their data

**Implementation**:

- Default privacy settings favor users
- Easy-to-use privacy controls in member portal
- Data retention policies enforced automatically

### Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention Period | Basis | Deletion Method |
|-----------|------------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Active Member PHI** | Duration of membership + 7 years | HIPAA | Crypto-shred (delete encryption keys) |
| **Claims Data** | 7 years from claim date | HIPAA, Tax | Crypto-shred |
| **Financial Records** | 7 years | IRS, State Regulators | Secure deletion |
| **Audit Logs** | 7 years | HIPAA | Secure deletion |
| **Wearable Data** | 2 years | Internal Policy | Purge from TimescaleDB |
| **De-identified Analytics Data** | Indefinite | Not PHI | N/A |

**Data Deletion Process**:
1. Member requests deletion via portal or written request
2. Compliance review (ensure no legal hold)
3. Automated deletion job scheduled
4. Crypto-shredding for encrypted data (delete keys)
5. Secure overwrite for non-encrypted data
6. Deletion confirmation to member (within 30 days)
7. Audit log entry (retained per retention policy)

### De-identification

**Purpose**: Allow data analytics without PHI restrictions.

**Safe Harbor Method** (HIPAA):
Remove 18 identifiers:
1. Names
2. Geographic subdivisions smaller than state
3. Dates (except year)
4. Phone/fax numbers
5. Email addresses
6. SSN
7. Medical record numbers
8. Health plan numbers
9. Account numbers
10. Certificate/license numbers
11. Vehicle identifiers
12. Device identifiers
13. URLs
14. IP addresses
15. Biometric identifiers
16. Full-face photos
17. Any other unique identifying number
18. Ages >89 aggregated

**Expert Determination** (Alternative):
- Statistical analysis by qualified expert

**Implementation**:
- Automated de-identification pipeline
- Separate de-identified data warehouse
- No reverse linkage to identified data
